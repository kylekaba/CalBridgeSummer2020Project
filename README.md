# UC Irvine - Cal-Bridge Summer 2020 Repository
## Project: Weighing the Supermassive Black Hole in the Massive Early-Type Galaxy, NGC 4786.
### Graduate Student Mentor: Kyle K. M. Kabasares 

The following repository contains Jupyter notebooks and routines in Python 3 that were used to help instruct and guide an undergraduate summer research project in the Summer of 2020. This was part of [Cal-Bridge](https://www.cpp.edu/calbridge/index.shtml), a program that creates opportunities for individuals from historically underrepresented groups within the California State University System to participate in summer research experiences at University of California campuses. 

In the summer of 2020, our research group at UC Irvine (remotely) welcomed Janelle Sy of California State Polytechnic University, Pomona to undertake a 2-month research project. During this summer, Janelle was tasked with dynamically weighing the supermassive black hole in the giant elliptical galaxy, NGC 4786. To help her with this goal, I created this repository with the necessary Python codes to analyze the radio astronomical data from the Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array. 

After the completion of this summer project, Janelle presented her work virutally at the 237th Meeting of the American Astronomical Society, the largest astronomy conference in the United States. Her AAS 237 iPoster can be viewed [here](https://aas237-aas.ipostersessions.com/?s=2B-FA-0B-DD-56-7C-8A-04-5F-76-60-A9-4D-D5-AF-71).

As of this writing in April 2023, I am currently in the process of completing the work that she started and will be submitting a paper for publication to *The Astrophysical Journal* relatively soon.
